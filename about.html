            <p>
                I wanted to know what the most popular street names in my country
                were. Who were all those men and women I saw everywhere on street
                signs, some of which quite popular, some I've never even heard of
                before. Eventually, out of curiosity, I've extended my search to my
                neighbouring countries and, finally, to all the countries in the
                world.
            </p>

            <h4> Method </h4>
            <p>
                I've analyzed all the street names from 
                <a target="_blank" href="http://download.geofabrik.de/index.html">OpenStreetMap</a>
                (osm) and kept only those named after a person (eponyms). For each
                country in turn I've sorted the names by their frequency and I've
                added wikipedia links to them.
            </p>

            <p>
                The osm data is not consistent from country to country and there is
                no clear separation between names of streets, bridges, squares,
                public buildings or any other similar landmarks. As a result, all
                such landmarks are taken into consideration, as long as they are
                eponyms. So <q>street names</q> was a bit of a useful lie to get you
                this far.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I've sometimes also included the names of 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulcinea_del_Toboso">fictional characters</a>,
                or a
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaycuru_peoples">group of people</a>
                if those are well-known or important from a historical point of view.
            </p>
            <p>
                To avoid duplicate entries, there is only one name allowed per city.
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mihaiolteanu/ulitza/blob/main/affixes.js">Affixes</a>
                like <q>street</q>, <q>boulevard</q>, <q>square</q> and similar ones, are
                removed. If more than one name refers to the same person, they are
                considered <a href="_blank" href="https://github.com/mihaiolteanu/ulitza/blob/main/equivalents.js#L40">equivalent</a>
                and are not counted more than once.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides the per-country eponyms frequency, having all this data
                allows for an extra piece of information. Who are the persons
                appearing most often around the world? The front page presents just
                that. Every count besides every name is clickable and lists the name
                of countries where that name appears in.
            </p>
            
            <h4> Limitations </h4>
            <p>
                I'm mostly familiar with the European names and those were the
                easiest to find out and fill wikipedia links for. Even the US,
                Canada, Australia and the UK are sometimes hard to figure out since
                they contain only the family name and it's not always clear who it
                refers to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arabic is another challange but one that I was able to overcome here
                and there. A knowledgable eye is still needed here, as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                China, Korea and Japan are, unfortunately, a complete mistery to
                me. I cannot even figure out what the affixes are, so that I can
                remove them. India is mixed-up and it's hard for an outsider to
                figure out the structure of the osm data. Help would greatly be
                appreciated in these cases, as well.
            </p>              

            <p>
                If your favorite country or hero is missing or I've attributed some
                links to the wrong persons, the error is mine, and it is an error or
                an omission and not a deliberate act. I'm more than happy to correct
                or add the missing data if proven beyond doubt that the information
                provided is correct. Check the github page and, more importantly, the
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mihaiolteanu/ulitza/tree/main/eponyms">eponyms</a>
                folder where all the eponyms and all the magic happens.

            <h4> Etymology </h4>
            <p>
                <b>ulitza</b> is a non-standard way of writing <b>uliță</b> without
                using any special characters (cedilla, in this case) as to keep the
                pronounciation. It is a Romanian word meaning a narrow road, used
                most frequently for streets in small villages borderd on both sides
                by houses, in contradiction to the city boulevards, for example.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is derived from a proto-slavic word,
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ulica">ulita</a>,
                and it has many variants in most of the Eastern-Europeean countries,
                like <q>ulica</q> (Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Slovenia),
                <q>utca</q> (Hungary), <q>ulice</q> (Czech Republic), <q>у́лица</q>(úlica)
                (Russia, Ukraine) or <q>вуліца</q> (vúlica) (Belarus).
            </p>
